# Interpreter
The project Interpreter takes file ‘__.x.cod’ as input and processes the bytecodes to produce the output. Interpreter implements an abstract class ByteCode which would be inherited by all byte code classes, and VirtualMachine class which would carry out all the operations for bytecodes and RunTimeStack class which would store all the current stack values
